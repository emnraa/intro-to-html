    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Emily Rattanavong and I am a senior this year majoring in
      Advertising and Public Relations with a minor in music. I am taking this
      class because I think it is a super helpful skill to know and put on my
      resume. I really like to look at other s tudents' work, which is part of
      what makes this class so enjoyable! In the future, it is my goal to work
      within the fashion industry.

      My favorite activites right now are playing piano (because I'm in two
      music classes right now) and cooking, which I never used to do. Over
      quarantine, I wanted to feel productive and taught myself some new skills.
      Recently, I taught myself how to sew, and have been looking into a lot of
      different designers, which is super interesting to me! One of my favorites
      at the moment is Iris Van Herpen, someone who makes beautiful and creative
      designs.
